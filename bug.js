function foo(a,b){    if(a === 0){        return b;    }else if (b === 0){        return a;    }else{        return foo(a -1, b -1);    } }console.log(foo(5,5)); //it should return 5 but returns 0. The reason is that the recursive function is not stopping when one of the condition is met, it keeps going until one of the arguments is equal to zero. So the function will always return 0
