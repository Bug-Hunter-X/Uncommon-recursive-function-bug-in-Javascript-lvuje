# Uncommon recursive function bug in Javascript
This repository contains a javascript code example that demonstrates a common mistake when writing recursive functions. The function `foo` is designed to return the value of `a` if `b` is 0, and the value of `b` if `a` is 0. Otherwise it should return the result of a recursive call to `foo` with `a-1` and `b-1`. However, due to the way the base cases and recursive step are defined, it always ends up returning 0 regardless of the input values.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly implement the function to achieve the desired behavior.
